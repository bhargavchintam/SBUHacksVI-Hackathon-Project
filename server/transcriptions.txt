Please summarise the below:
phone there are nearly 100 million transistors in this computer there's over a billion the transistor is in virtually every electronic device we
 TVs radios Tamagotchis but how does it work well the basic principles actually incredibly simple it works just like this switch so controls the flow of electric current it can be off so you could call that the zero state or it could be on the 1 State and this is how all of our information is now stored and processed in zeros and ones little bits of electric current but unlike this switch a transistor doesn't have any moving parts and it also doesn't require a human controller furthermore it can be switched on and off much more quickly than I can flick this switch and finally and most importantly it is incredibly tiny well this is all thanks to the miracle of semiconductor
 or rather I should say the science semiconductors
 pure silicon is a semiconductor which means it conducts electric current better than insulators but not as well as Metals this is because an atom of silicon has 4 electrons in its outermost or valence shell
 this allows it to form bonds with its for nearest neighbors what's that so it forms a tetrahedral Crystal but since all these electrons are stuck in bonds few ever get enough energy to escape their bonds and travel through the lattice so having a small number of mobile charges is what makes silicon a semiconductor now this wouldn't be all that useful without a semiconductor's secret weapon
 doping you've probably heard of doping it's when you inject a foreign substance in order to Performance
 yeah it's actually just like that except on the atomic level there are 2 types of doping called nype and pype to make n-type semiconductor you take pure silicon and inject a small amount of an element with 5 valence electrons like phosphorus
 this is useful because phosphorus is similar enough to Silicon that it can fit into the lattice but it brings with it an extra electron so this means now the semiconductor has more mobile chargers and so it conducts current better
 in ptype doing an element with only 3 valence electrons is added to the lattice like Boron now this creates a hole a place where there should be an electron but there isn't but this still increases the conductivity of the semiconductor because electrons can move into it
 now although it's the electrons that are moving we like to talk about the holes moving around because there's far fewer of them
 as a positive
 and this is why ptype semiconductor is actually called ptype the P stands for positive it's positive charges these holes which are moving and conducting the current now it's a common misconception that NT type semiconductors are negatively charged and P types are positively charged that's not true they are both neutral because they have the same number of electrons and protons inside them the n and the P actually just refer to the sign of charge that can move within them so in N type it's negative electrons which can move and in ptype it's a positive hole that moves but they're both neutral a transistor is made with both n-type and p-type semiconductors a common configuration has n on the ends with P in the middle just like a switch a transistor has an electrical contact at each end and these are called the source and the drain but instead of a switch there is a third electrical contact called the gate which is insulated from the semiconductor by an oxide layer
 when a transistor is made the n and p types don't keep to themselves electrons actually diffuse from the N type where there are more of them into the pype to fill the holes
 this creates something called the depletion layer what's been depleted charges that can move there are no more free electrons in the N type why
 because they filled the holes in the pype now this makes the ptype negative thanks to the added electrons and this is important because the pype will now repel any electrons at try to come across from the N type so the depletion layer actually acts as a barrier preventing the flow of electric current through the transistor so right now the transistor is off it's like an open switch it's in the zero state to turn it on
